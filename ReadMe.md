RodoSampleApp
Swift+UIKit
Built for version ios v11+

This is a simple app which creates a tab-view controller based navigation system with only the first tab partially implemented.

The first tab is a search screen with a navigation controller to select vehicle type. 

( The vehicle type is currently unused )

A TextField on the first page is used to search a list of car Items for make and model.

The logic for search is in HomeViewControllerViewModel and uses a generic search system that is implemented in InventoryListModel. 

Project can be built in XCode, and has test cases in RodoSampleAppTests.

Should display properly for all iPhone/iPad screens.
